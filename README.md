# An Analysis of kickstarter Campaigns

## Kickstarter data analysis

Use excel to find Trends and Patterns:

* Formating, filtering,  the data for initial data exploration and analysis - See Kickstarter worksheet
 
* Create new variables (Columns) and Debugging using excel formulas: See Kickstarter worksheet

_ _  Percentage Funded, Average Donation, Parent Category, Subcategory
_ _  Date Created Conversion, Date Ended Conversion by converting Unix Timestamps to Readable Format

* Creating Pivot Tables and Charts - See Workbook data 1-1-3-StarterBook:
_ _ Category Statistics, Subcategory Statistics, Outcomes Based on Launch Date

* Box-Plots and a Five-Number Summary (i.e. The minimum, Q1 (the first quartile), the median, Q3 (the third quartile), the maximum) - See Box Plots worksheet
